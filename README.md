**Project Description: Using Natural Disaster Data**

**Introduction:**
I, representing the UNDDR (United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction), am dedicated to reducing disaster risks worldwide. In this project, I have collected and analyzed data on natural disasters to better understand their distribution and impact. I use visualization technologies such as Leaflet.js, d3.js, and Charts.js to represent this data interactively and informatively.

**Data Collection and Processing:**
I gathered data from various sources on natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. These data are stored in JSON and TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files. Each dataset contains valuable information such as location, magnitude, date, and other relevant details for each event.

**Data Visualization on Maps:**
Using Leaflet.js and d3.js, I created interactive maps to visualize the geographical distribution of natural disasters. Each type of disaster is represented by a distinct marker on the map, allowing users to explore affected areas and obtain specific information about each event by clicking on the markers.

**Analysis of Tsunami Frequency:**
I also utilized Charts.js to create a bar chart illustrating the frequency of tsunamis over time. This visualization helps understand trends and variations in the number of tsunamis over a given period, aiding in risk assessment and appropriate preventive measures.

**Objectives:**
My main objective is to raise awareness about the importance of disaster preparedness and to provide actionable insights for decision-making. By visualizing the data clearly and concisely, I aim to encourage the implementation of risk reduction measures and emergency planning.

**Conclusion:**
By combining data collection, analysis, and visualization, our project provides a comprehensive insight into past and current natural disasters. I believe this initiative will assist policymakers, emergency response agencies, and communities in better preparedness and response to disasters, ultimately contributing to saving lives and reducing losses.
